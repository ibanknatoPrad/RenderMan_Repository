This is the README file for the texture demos for Ken Musgrave's
example procedural shaders from Chapter 8 of:

    _Texturing and Modeling: A Procedural Approach_, by David S. Ebert,
    F. Kenton Musgrave, Darwyn Peachey, Ken Perlin, and Steven Worley.
    Academic Press, 1994.  ISBN 0-12-228760-6.


These examples consist of RenderMan (R) Shading Language source code
and RIB (RenderMan Interface Bytestream) for sample scenes using the
shaders.  RenderMan is a registered trademark of Pixar.  All rights
reserved.

These RIB files and shaders have been tested on both Pixar's
PhotoRealistic RenderMan (prman), and the Blue Moon Rendering Tools
(see the file BMRT.Announce for details about this shareware package).

Here's how to view the demos:

1. Type one of the following commands at the UNIX prompt (depending on
   whether you're using prman or BMRT):

		make -f Makefile.prman
       - or -
		make -f Makefile.bmrt

2. This will cause all of the shaders to compile and the RIB files to render.
   Sit back and relax, it will take several minutes to render the image
   files.

3. Use your favorite TIFF image viewer to display these files.  Don't
   forget to gamma correct as necessary for your display device.


Final note: some of the Shading Language files from chapter 2 (Darwyn
Peachey's chapter) didn't run properly with earlier versions of BMRT.
If you have trouble, please get the current version.
