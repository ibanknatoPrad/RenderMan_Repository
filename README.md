## Background
This is a snapshot (aprox. 2010) of renderman.org  also known as The RenderMan Repository.

In its day it was the goto resource for RenderMan related information.  In fact it was a source that Pixar referred to when Toy Story was released.  Also many people teaching RenderMan would refer to it as a resource.

A lot has changed with RenderMan and the RenderMan community since then.  The intention is to provide the snapshot as a historical reference.  Namely once again provide access to the RenderMan SIGGRAPH courses, Stupid RenderMan Tricks, and access to various shaders that were on the site.

So far I haven't tried to make the HTML pages and their internal links work (and perhaps, I may not bother).  Also, most of the external links are most likely extremely stale.  Instead you can manually run through the directories to get at their contents.

Some directories that may be of interest include:

* RMR/Shaders
* RMR/Utils 
  * gelato/rsl2gsl -- a translator I wrote to convert RenderMan shaders to Gelato shaders
* RMR/Publications -- RenderMan courses and other items. See [Copyright](#copyright) section below.
* st/PRMan_Filtering  -- Brent Burley's study with different filtering methods that he did during the movie **Bolt** and as a precursor to his Ptex work.
