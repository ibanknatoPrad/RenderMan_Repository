README file for "Chapter 17"

This section is not a chapter in the RenderMan Companion; it is a tutorial
on PhotoRealistic RenderMan describing attributes and options that affect
the rendering performance in various ways.

The organization of the section is one "example-set" for most options
and attributes described.  Each "example-set" comprises one example
in some cases but usually two examples, one "this-is-bad" and one
"this-is-how-you-fix-it".  The directory thus contains one main program
for each "example-set", and one opt_ file for each EXAMPLE.

There is also one file, opt.c, containing the option settings that generally do
not vary from example to example (RiFormat, for example), a readme file (this),
a makefile for running the examples, and two shaders used in the examples.

Examples 1 & 2 (bucketsize):
---------------------------
sphere.c:	Main program which draws a sphere.
opt_1.c:	Example-specific options. 
opt_2.c:	Example-specific options. 

Examples 3 & 4 (eye-plane splitting):
-----------------------------------
eyesplit.c:	Main program which draws several yellow spikes crossing
		the eye plane.
opt_3.c:	Example-specific options. 
opt_4.c:	Example-specific options. 

Examples 5 & 6 (jitter):
-----------------------
jitter.c:	Main program which draws a long (aliased) red checkerboard.
opt_5.c:	Example-specific options. 
opt_6.c:	Example-specific options. 

Examples 7 & 8 (shadow map bias):
--------------------------------
shadow.c:	Main program which draws a small sphere beside a large one.
opt_7.c:	Example-specific options. 
opt_8.c:	Example-specific options. 
shadowlight.sl:	A distant light shader which casts shadows.

Example 9 (display origin):
--------------------------
offset.c:	Main program which draws four frames of a sphere with
		different colors.
opt_9.c:	Example-specific options. 

Examples 10 & 11 (binary dicing):
--------------------------------
bindice.c:	Main program which draws a bezier-patch version of a sphere.
opt_10.c:	Example-specific options. 
opt_11.c:	Example-specific options. 

Examples 12 & 13 (displacement bounds):
--------------------------------------
cylinder.c:	Main program which draws a cylinder with "wave" displacement
		shader.
opt_12.c:	Example-specific options. 
opt_13.c:	Example-specific options. 
wave.sl:	Displacement shader for sinusoidal waves.
