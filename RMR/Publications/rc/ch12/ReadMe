ReadMe file for chapter 12

This chapter will require much more user interaction than usual.

If you are using Larry Gritz' BMRT, then you will need to change any references for texture-maps from filename.tx to filename.tiff or if you prefer make a symbolic link from the filename.tiff to filename.tx.

If you are using Pixar's prman, then you will need to produce the texture-maps by hand.  The Makefile won't do it for you.  

envr12_3.c -- Contains the listings for both 12.3 and 12.4.
