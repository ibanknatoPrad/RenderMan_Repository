Listing of files in the ch8 directory

NOTE: There is a bug somewhere in one of the files used to build listings 
listing8_3.gen and listing8_4.gen. -- I haven't tracked it down yet.  The message from prman is:

Warning in context RMContext00001 in command RiClipping:  IllegalNesting:  
        inside 'camera' block.

For the Makefile you will need to provide for the following variables:

RMAN_LIB, RIDIR, RUN_RMAN, OTHER_LIBS and CC.

They are described in the Makefile
