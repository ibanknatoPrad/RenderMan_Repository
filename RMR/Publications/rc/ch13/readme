README file for Chapter 13

    The only example in this chapter is the application of a "clouds" shader
to the bezier bowling pin created in chapter 6.  Note that the line numbers
presented in Listing 13.1 should NOT be included in the source code file.

Corrections and Additions:

Listing 13.1:
-------------
    This is the standard Bezier bowling pin from chapter 6 with two changes:
the color is set to a light blue, and a call to RiSurface() is used to 
access the clouds shader.
    The "clouds" shader in this directory differs from the presentation in
The RenderMan Companion.  The book's listing results in an extremely dark 
image because the sum of the noise rarely exceeds 0.1.  Although lighting 
can be used here, a more effective looking shader ignores the lights and 
scales the sum somewhat.  The following changes are made in the shader:

    1. Substitute line 9, the declaration of "refl", with the declaration 
       of "white".

       color white = color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

    2. Delete line 17, the assignment of "refl".

    3. Replace line 18, the assignment of "Ci" with:

       Ci = mix(Cs, white, sum*4.0);

    Notice that there is a numbering error in the book; 19 is applied to 
two lines in the listing.
