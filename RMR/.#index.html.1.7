<P>Check out an  excerpt from the <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/renderman-faq/">FAQ</A>

<A HREF="mailto:lg@SpamSucks_exluna.com">Larry Gritz</A>.<P>
Also, reading the <B>FAQ</B> is a good way to make your posts to the <a href="#pixarTM">RenderMan®</a> Newsgroup (<A HREF="news:comp.graphics.rendering.renderman">news:comp.graphics.rendering.renderman</A>) be more intelligent and less annoying to us old timers on the newsgroup.  There is nothing more annoying (well, ok Spammers are much worse), then questions like <I>"Where can I get <a href="#pixarTM">RenderMan®</a>?"

<H2>What's here (or what will be here)?</H2>
<P></P>
<P>The purpose of this Repository is to help spread the lore of <a href="#pixarTM">RenderMan®</a>.</P>
<P><B>The RMR consists of about 30 HTML pages, 30 Megs of data and around 150 shaders at last count.  Plus there of dozens of <A HREF="/RMR/OtherLinks/index.html">links</A> to various other <a href="#pixarTM">RenderMan®</a> related sites.</B></P>
<P>This site is your site too, so don't be just a lurker. If you have
something to share, by all means feel free to do so. This site will become
only as good as you help make it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Don't feel you have to have finished work either. I have been considering
building a &quot;Work in Progress&quot; section, for code that doesn't produce
the desired results or are wondering if there is a better way of doing it.
</P>
<P>OF NOTE:  I use <b>Pixar's prman</b> and </A> <A HREF="http://www.bmrt.org/"> BMRT</A> under UNIX based OSes like SGI, Linux, and NeXTSTEP.  So if information seems slanted towards these renders and environments, it is because they are what I know and use on a daily basis.</P>
<P>However, these renders and others do run under other OSes.  For example, <B>BMRT</B> now runs under W95 and NT!<P>

<IMG SRC="/RMR/Pics/redball.gif"><b>Changed Email Addresses</b>
<br>
It looks like somebody has started scanning web pages for email addresses.  I have changed everybody's address listed in the RMR, to something that will bounce.  Now you will have to check the address and edit out the garbage.  Sorry.
<p>
Also if it looks like you recieved mail from either my pacbell or renderman account and it didn't have anything to do with renderman, I didn't send it and now you know how you got selected.

<IMG SRC="/RMR/Pics/redball.gif"><b>TkMatMan</b>  02/24/02<br>
Version 1.9 of TkMatMan shader previewer has been released.  It now supports Entropy, in addition to BMRT, 3Delight, RenderDotC and PRMan. Some of the
other new features are: support for normal and matrix
shader parameters, option for a checkered patch under
the object for testing transparent, reflective and/or
refractive materials, float parameters now accept
negative values, and several more. TkMatMan is
available for download from RenderMania (both the
Tcl/Tk scripts and the Windows executables)  -
<a href="http://www.rendermania.com/downloads.shtml">http://www.rendermania.com/downloads.shtml</a> and from the 'Files' section of the BMRT Yahoo! Group (just the scripts) - <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bmrt">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bmrt</a>

<IMG SRC="/RMR/Pics/redball.gif"><b><a href="http://rhinoman.renderology.com/">RhinoMan</a></b>  02/24/02<br>
<b>RhinoMan</b> update:
<pre>
1. The help files have been updated to include context sensitive help
for many of the RhinoMan windows. (press F1 in the window)

2. The installer has been fixed so it installs BMRT correctly if it
locates BMRT and it has not been configured. This fixes the "black
rendering" problem that occurred because BMRT couldn't find any shaders.

3. The RenderManager now correctly reports errors it finds. It wasn't
reporting errors at all.

4. Shadow maps did not correctly work on dual processor systems
5. Dual processor rendering was broken.
6. The RhinoMan display is now an added option to the "file" and
"framebuffer" display options.
7. The CloseDisplayWindow command now closes the last rendering started.

8. The RhinoManRenderModal command toggles the rendering mode to mimic
Rhinos' behavior when rendering. This is useful for rendering using a
script such as the animation workspace.

<H3>SIGGRAPH 2001 Tidbits</H3>
<IMG SRC="/RMR/Pics/redball.gif"><b>Pixar</b>: 
<UL PLAIN COMPACT TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>The next release of PRMan will be called PRMan 10.  This is no one confuses 3.10 with 3.1.<br>
Some features are to include:</LI>
<UL TYPE=DISC> 
<LI>support for Mipmap TIFF files</LI>
<LI>User defined variables in the RIB stream</LI>
<LI>Lights handles are now strings rather than floats to better guarantee that the handles will be unique.  This will be useful to help prevent collisions when including various RIBs that have lights baked into them.</LI>
<LI>Inline Archives - is what object instancing should have been</LI>
<LI>Render checkpointing - Say your 3 hour render job gets killed when it is 3/4 of the way complete.  You can start up the render again with a command line flag and it will start up close to where it left off.  (I suspect that this means starting up at the previous bucket, but I am just guessing).  This feature currently only will work with TIFF files.</LI>
<LI>Directory Mapping - this allows for people with heterogeneous computing environments to specify and alternate search path for a second architecture.  (I suspect this is mainly for going between NT and Unix)</LI>
<LI>The restrictions for Arbitrary Output Variables (AOVs) have been removed.  This means that the data can use the internal filters (rather than being forced to use Box 1 1).  Also the restriction on the number of AOVs has been removed.  (Before you couldn't have more than 8)</LI>
<LI>Can now have arbitrary clipping planes for culling scenes.</LI>
<LI>Soft Shadows have been sped up.</LI>
<LI>The 32 character shader parameter limit has been removed.</LI>
<LI>Lots of others features that I have forgotten already.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>RAT 5.0 - Remember RAT4.5 was release early last month. It had a ton of new features like:
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Support for Maya 3 and Maya 4.0
<LI>Direct support for Maya Subds
<LI>Blobby modeling
<LI>Manual and automatic RIB archiving
<LI>Slim Adaptors (My personal favorite)
<LI>Multi-segment motion blur
<LI>CSG support
<LI>Level of Detail
<LI>All revised documentation with a search engine
<LI>and lots of other things
</UL>
Well now one month later we have two main new additions to look forward to:
<UL type=disc>
<LI>IRMA - A pseudo interactive <a href="#pixarTM">RenderMan®</a> renderer.  Basically you do an Irma pre-render which should take about the same time as a regular render.  Then you fiddle around with your Slim parameter values for your shaders/lights and click the "re-render" button and the renderer only renders the things affected by your changes!  There are controls for affecting the level of recomputing that is desired also with the help of alfred it can make use of other processors on your farm.  So think of it as netrender on steroids.
<LI>Easier piece-wise subdivision texture painting (I have forgotten what this feature is called but here is the essence:)  You can now break up your subds (with certain restrictions) into sections, paint on these sections in your 3D paint program, then render out your subd with those texture maps. In the past there were problems along the edges of these boundaries.  (But now I believe each edge gets multiple texture coordinates so the right set is applied depending on the context) 
</UL>
<LI>Both PRMan 10 and RAT 5 should be out before the end of the year.
</UL>
<IMG SRC="/RMR/Pics/redball.gif"><b>Side Effects Houdini</b>:
<UL PLAIN type=square>
<LI>The modeler has been completely redone.  It is actually interactive.  So you only need to fiddle with numbers if you want some specific fine control.
<LI>There are Tons and Tons of other cool things.
<LI>Also at the user's group they announced <b>Houdini Select</b>(I believe this is a subset of regular Houdini) for $1999.  
</UL>
<IMG SRC="/RMR/Pics/redball.gif"><b>Exluna</b>:
<UL type=square>
<LI>Exluna showed off <b>Entropy</b> at the <b>Discreet</b> booth.  There was always a big crowd there.
<LI>If you want to see some of what they showed check out their <a href="http://www.exluna.com/products/gallery_entropy.html">image gallery</a>.
<LI>They should be shipping RSN
</UL>
<IMG SRC="/RMR/Pics/redball.gif"><b>Misc <a href="#pixarTM">RenderMan®</a> info</b>:
<UL type=square>
<LI>Level of Detail seems to be finally catching on!  In the <a href="#pixarTM">RenderMan®</a> course notes, the ILM guys talked about how they used it for <i>TPM</i>, <i>Mummy 2</i>.  Another group from <b>ILM</b> in another mentioned that they used it on  <i>Perl Harbor</i>.<br>
Charlotte Manning, from <b>DD</b>, talked (see Skecthes and Applications CD #271 PDF page 134) about how they used it for <i>Grinch</i> their renders went from 5 hours to 5 minutes!
<LI>Ian Stephenson presented <a href="Examples/index.html#Inoise">Inoise</a> an Integrated Perlin Noise DSO shader op.

<LI>John Haddon gave a talk on using vector-based texture maps (see Skecthes and Applications CD #208 PDF page 71).
<LI>Thouis Jones, Ronald Perry, and Michael Callahan talked about <a href="Examples/index.html#Shadermaps">Shadermaps</a> to accelerate procedural shading.
<LI>Chris Tchou showed off HDR Shop.  A cool little tool that has various operations for dealing with High Dynamic Range images.  It supports making cube face maps as well as dumping out RIB snippets for lighting information.

<P class="indent">On a related topic, I won't accept any binaries (pictures excepted) such as compiled shader files, etc.  If you have a shader that you would like to share but don't want to distribute the source or if you have some shaders that you would like to sell.

<P class="indent">
<B>A)</B> If it is just source -- make sure you include some comments telling us this is yours, so we know who it came from and who to give credit to.  Also, if you are sending a shader, make sure you include a simple RIB that shows the shader off.
