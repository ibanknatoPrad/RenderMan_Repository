The file val_poly.rib is a polygonal face in the RenderMan Interface Bytestream
(RIB) format. The face is that of Valerie Hall which was converted from the
files available from Curtin University in Australia.  

For more info from Curtin, contact Andrew Marriot there.

This is a very quick conversion. Only Polygons are used which looks fine
in Wireframe view, but not so hot at higher quality. I hope to convert it
to Patches or PatchMeshes at some stage. 

Thanks to Michael B. Johnson (Wave) for fixing up the code and inserting
comments at important points. You can contact him by
Email: wave@media.mit.edu  or  Web : wave.www.media.mit.edu/people/wave/

All updates, corrections, criticisms etc. are welcome.
