<H2>Saturn Animation</H2><P>
In honor of the Saturn plane occurring Monday May 22, I have created this little MPEG animation.  It is a fly-by of a Saturn like planet consisting of 60 frames 200x100 (&lt; 30K).  More information about the event can be found here:<P>

<B>(12/18/96 Tal--This animation seems to only play correctly under the MPEG player under NeXTSTEP.  So here is a <A HREF="../st/sat.mov">MOV animation</A>

.  This version is about 270k and the frames are 300x220.  NOTE:  It has been some time since I have seen this animation so large and I have noticed that the stars are way, too big.  It looks like they have been motion blurred, but this is not the case.  When, I get around to it , I may try doing another version that fixes this.)</B><P>

 (about 340K).<P>
Also, I have included <A HREF="../st/saturn.c">C source</A>

.  Which I feel will be more instructive than the RIB.  If you do decide to use the C source to generate the RIB, you will need  the <A HREF="../Books/RC/rcCh8.htmld/index.html#ex8_2">camera code</A>
.  <B>NOTE: The C source for the Terran animation  offers a much better frame-work!  I highly recommend using that one if you plan on hacking with the code.</B><P>

.  Also, this source is much better than the saturn.c.  Mainly, all of the elements have been moved to function calls.   Making much more straight forward to use the same frame-work for other planets.  Another feature that many BMRT users may find useful is now the frames can be rendered independently (using the -frames option).  The saturn animation required the frames to be rendered sequentially from first to last.<P>

<B>3/2/97 -- This animation has been a long time in the making.  I had started it nearly two years ago.  But I was never really happy with it and never found  the time to work on it.  Then last weekend, I decided to try and wrap it up.</B>

<P>
There are still some things I am not happy with:  need to work on a better sun,
maybe throw in a couple of moons.  Maybe add a semi-transparent sphere around the planet to add some atmospherics.  The nebula could be better too.
<P>
I started out with a picture of the Orion Nebula from the Hubble Space Telescope.  The original image can be found at
<A HREF="http://oposite.stsci.edu/ftp/pubinfo/tiff/oria.tiff">http://oposite.stsci.edu/ftp/pubinfo/tiff/oria.tiff</A> -- 1M.  <P>

Here is an excerpt of the press release that goes with the image.<P>

GAS PLUME NEAR THE EDGE OF ORION NEBULA         STSCI PR-92-29A
Wide Field/Planetary Camera

This HST "true color" mosaic image of a small portion of the Orion
Nebula shows a wealth of detail never seen before.  New features
include: elongated objects oriented on the brightest stars in this
region (which are located just off the edge of the picture); rapidly
expanding plumes of material around young stars and protoplanetary
disks.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
</I>
<P>
Ater getting the original image, I changed the aspect ration to 1:1 (RenderMan likes textures that are power of 2), staturated the colors, and rotated it.  Then this is what I used for the texture-map. (<B> The original is on the left and the new converted one is on the right. The images are scaled to aprox. 25%.  Clicking on them will download the full image.  1M and 0.47M respectfully.</B>)

 That's right another boring bouncing ball animation.  NOTE: I am not trying to simulate any laws of physics.  But this does give a good feel for the shader and there is some subtle motion blurring.<P>

<P>
Just an orange rolling in the fog.  This was inspired from a slide from Sharron Calihan's Lighting Class at Siggraph '96.  Nothing too fancy.  But something about it looked kind of cool.  <P>
<P>
I may do another version from a different camera postion.<P>
<P>
Things, I am not happy with:  <P>
<P>
1) The orange isn't that great (one factor may be is that it is just bump-mapped, rather than being displaced)<P>
<P>
2) The shadow, on the orange, looks kind of  funky (ie. it is very hard and straight).  Again this might be an artifact of the orange only being bump-mapped.<P>
<P>
3) May want more ambient light to see more of the orange near the ground.<P>
<P>
If anybody has any improvements or ideas on how to improve it, please let me know.<P>
