03/26/08<BR>
 Added link to the <a href="/twiki/bin/view/RenderManRepository/WebHome">RMR Twiki</a> page to the navagation table for the site.
 <p>
 
03/13/08<BR>
Fixed typo on rmBlockers page that had a bad link to the Examples page.
<p>
Switch out search engine to google.  Now can search through the all of the PDF documents on the site.
<p>
The RMR is in the process of a much needed face lift.  Also will be added several new pages and a TWiki section so others can more easily share their knowledge and information.
<p>
Worse case this will be in place by SIGGRAPH this year.  But I am hoping to have it unline much sooner.
10/20/07<BR>
Fixed some typos linking to the <a href="Examples/srt2007/index.html">SRT 2007</a> page and on the SRT2007 page itself.
<p>
10/09/07<BR>
 Finally the <b>Stupid RAT Tricks</b> for 2007 are <a href="Examples/srt2007/index.html">here</a>.
 <p>
08/06/07<BR>
 SIGGRAPH update(s).  Check out the <a href="/RMR/index.html#Announce">Newsworthy</a> section for some interesting bits at SIGGRAPH this year.
 <p>
 
06/25/07<BR>
Added a link to Blizzard Entertainment who is looking for a RenderMan shader writer in the <a href="/RMR/index.html#Announce">Newsworthy</a> section.
<p>
01/25/07<BR>
Added two more speakers to <a href="/RMR/Examples/index.html#SRT">SRT 2006</a>: Simon Haegler and Dan Maas.
<p>
Updated <a href="http://www.renderman.org/RMR/Utils/gelato/index.html#ribelato">ribelato</a> to rev 1.0.0.24.
<p>
12/19/06<BR>
Finally got around to adding the <a href="/RMR/Publications/index.html#Sig">SIGGRAPH 2006 Xtras</a>.  NOTE due to size contraints I had to convert one of the image files <i>brickColor.tif</i> (16bit) to <i>brickColor.jpg</i> (8bit).
<p>

Also speaking of SIGGRAPH, I have started a page on Stupid RAT Tricks <a href="/RMR/Examples/index.html#SRT">2006</a>.  But so far only <i>Mach</i> has given me any materials.
<p>
I recieved email from Larry Gritz a little while back pointing out a typo in <a href="/RMR/Publications/index.html#Advanced">Advanced RenderMan</a>'s <a href="/RMR/Publications/arman/shaders/patterns.h">filteredsmoothstep</a>:
<pre>
<code>
Original source for the <b>filtedsmoothstep</b>

float filteredsmoothstep (float e0, e1, x, dx)
{
    float integral (float t) {
	return -0.5*t*t * (t*t <b>+ t</b>);
    }
    . . .
}

Correct start of the function:

float filteredsmoothstep (float e0, e1, x, dx)
{
    float integral (float t) {
        return -0.5*t*t * (t*t - <b>2*t</b>);
    }
    . . .
}
</code>
</pre>
The file has been updated.
<p>

<p>
07/30/06<BR>
Added <a href="index.html#Announce">announcement</a> announcing that the course notes for the RenderMan course are online.  (A little early than normal, but as the attendees don't have them either, it didn't seem right to make them wait, too.)
