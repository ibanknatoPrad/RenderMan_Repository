 * DWParquetTile.sl -- yet another surface shader for wood
 *-was:
 * parquet_plank.sl -- another surface shader for wood.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Makes texture of wooden planks in s-t space.  This wood looks rather
 *   like oak plank parquet floor tiles.  The actual wood and plank pattern
 *   is based on my "planks" shader.  This shader works best if "s" and "t"
 *   units are both the same size in world space.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *   Ka, Kd, Ks, specular, roughness - work just like the plastic shader
 *   txtscale - overall scaling factor for the texture
 *   plankwidth - width of each plank (in terms of s/t)
 *   plankspertile - number of planks in each parquet tile
 *   ringscale - scaling for the ring spacing
 *   grainscale - scaling for the fine grain
 *   groovewidth - width of the grooves between the planks (in terms of s/t)
 *   lightwood, darkwood - surface colors for the wood itself
 *   groovecolor - the color of the "grooves" between the planks
 *   plankvary - controls how much wood color varies from plank to plank
 *   grainy - relative graininess (0 = no fine grain)
 *   wavy - relative wavyness of the ring pattern
 *
 * ANTIALIASING: this shader does a pretty good job of antialiasing itself,
 *   even with low sampling densities.

 *    10 Feb 1995 - written by Larry Gritz, based on my "plank" shader.
 *    10 Feb 1995 - modified by wave to change the name

 *   - made one plank per tile like the flooring in our lab
 *   - comments appear where changes are made
 *   - many thanks to Larry Gritz and wave for creating the original
