Fake caustic shader.
The idea is that you apply this shader to a NURBs plane; witch by someway 
mimics the translation and size of the caustic. The shader will then alter 
the colour and opacity of the plane to mimic a caustic being casted on a 
surface. The shader will create a round caustic centred on the plane. But 
don't be afraid to "warp" the caustic by manipulating the CVs of your 
plane! 2 parts build up the caustic; noise Caustic (Nc) and radial caustic 
(Rc). Only where there is white in both the caustic will be visible. Get 
it?

When downloaded open AMcaustic.slim and AMcaustic.sl and fill in  
"The_search_path_to_Amcaustics.slo" in the second line.
