/* crayon.sl - a surface shader making crayon like marks

	DESCRIPTION

	This shader makes the surface look as if it had been shaded with a pastel crayon.
	It makes an attempt at antaliasing.
	
	PARAMETERS
	
	Ka, Kd, Ks, roughness, specularcolor - work as in the plastic shader
	txtscale  - an overall scaling factor
	width - the width of the crayon strokes - this is scaled by txtscale
	micro - the size of the dots that make up a crayon stroke, relative to the size of
		the stroke. By default they are about 15 times smaller
	stretch - the length of the stroke relative to its width;
	density0 - controls the amount of topcolor seen - measured as a proportion - 
		this should vary between 0 (no topcolor) to 1, .3 would give 30% topcolor;
	density1 - if different density0 this is the density when t = 1, with a smooth
		interpolation of values for density0 when t = 0, thus allowing a 
		graduation of shading from top to bottom of the object
	color topcolor, basecolor - the color of the crayon strokes and the color of the ground
