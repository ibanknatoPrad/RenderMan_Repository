/* I renamed the shader to MBVenus.sl -- tal AT renderman DOT org */

/*
 * venus.sl - surface for a very cloudy planet like Venus.
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      When put on a sphere, sets the color to look like a densely
 *   clouded planet, very much like the real Venus appears in UV.
 *      The shader works by creating a fractal turbulence function over
 *   the surface to simulate the clouds.  Strong Coriolis forces are
 *   simulated to give the twisting of clouds that is typically seen
 *   on Venus.
 *
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *    Ka, Kd - the usual meaning
 *    offset, scale - control the linear scaling of the cloud value.
 *    twist - controls the twisting of the clouds due to Coriolis forces.
 *    omega - controls the fractal characteristics of the clouds
 *    octaves - the number of octaves of noise to sum for the clouds.
 *    radius - radius of planet
 *
 *
 * AUTHOR: Ken Musgrave.
 *    Conversion to Shading Language and minor modifications by Larry Gritz.
 *    Planet radius param added by Mark Beckwith.
