/* screen.sl - RenderMan compatible shader for a metalic screen.
 * (c) Pixar (appears in _RenderMan Companion_)
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Makes a surface that looks like a metal screen.  Strips of metal run
 *   parallel to lines of s and t.  You can adjust the Ka, Kd, Ks, etc.
 *   to change the material appearance.
 * 
 * PARAMETERS:
 *   Ka, Kd, Ks, roughness, specularcolor - work just like the plastic shader
 *   frequency - how many cycles of screen in st space
 *   density - how much of each cycle is opaque?
 *
 * WARNINGS:
 *   No antialiasing is performed here.
 *
