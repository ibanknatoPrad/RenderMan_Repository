/*
 * EM_paper.sl -- loose leaf paper
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Makes a patch look like a piece of loose-leaf paper with lines,
 *   the margin, binder holes and writing (as an image texture).
 *   Works in s/t space.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *   Ka, Kd, Ks, specular, roughness - work just like the plastic shader
 *   linestr - how strongly do the lines show up (0.0 to 1.0)
 *   texturename - name of image to map onto paper (optional)
 *
 * ANTIALIASING: no antialiasing. This can be a real problem because of the
 *               thin lines on the paper.
 *

 *
 * HISTORY:
 *    8 Nov 1997 - started writing shader for RDC under MS VC++
 *    9 Nov 1997 - added binder holes and finished shader
 *   15 Nov 1997 - translated to Renderman SL in Linux

 *
 * COMMENTS:
 *   Don't worry about the paper anatomy settings. I moved them to
 *   the paper(...) block so that they get calculated on initialisation
 *   (initcode) instead of being re-calced for every sample.
 *
 *   I don't know how many holes there were in paper when _YOU_ were a kid
 *   but in my day there's 7. I actually got a piece of loose-leaf paper
 *   and got all the measurements with a ruler. This is the real thing!!
 *
 *   The paper shader works for A4 pieces of paper, so remeber to make your
 *   patch 21x29.7 units or at least with an approximate aspect ratio.
