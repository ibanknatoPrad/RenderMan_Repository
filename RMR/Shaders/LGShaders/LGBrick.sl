/*
 * brick.sl -- Surface shader for a bricks.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Makes a wall of bricks.  Need more be said?  OK.  It makes a good
 *   looking staggered brick masonry.  It is especially convincing when
 *   used in conjunction with the "brickbump" displacement shader (and
 *   identical parameters).  Every other row of bricks is staggered.
 *   The staggering isn't exact, however, and this variance is controlled
 *   by the "rowvary" parameter.
 * 
 * PARAMETERS:
 *    Ka, Kd			The usual
 *    brickcolor, mortarcolor	Pretty obvious (default is red bricks)
 *    brickvary                 How much does the brick color vary from
 *     				   brick to brick?
 *    brickwidth                Width of a brick (in st space)
 *    brickheight               Height of a brick (in st space)
 *    mortarthickness           Thickness of the mortar (in st space)
 *    rowvary                   How much does each row shift?
 *    jagged                    How much do bricks deviate from squares?
 *
 * AUTHOR: written by Larry Gritz, 1992
 * 	This shader is very similar to (and based upon) brick shaders
 *	by Darwyn Peachey.
 *
 * 
 * HISTORY:
 *      28 May 1992 -- written by lg for the "Timbre Trees" video (saucer)
 *      12 Jan 1994 -- recoded by lg in correct shading language.
