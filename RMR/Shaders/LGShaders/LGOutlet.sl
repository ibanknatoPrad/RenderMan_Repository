/*
 * outlet.sl -- surface shader for an electrical outlet
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Makes an electrical outlet.  Perfect for slapping on a bilinear
 *   patch to make a wall more interesting.  The patch should be
 *   twice as high as it is wide.  *Totally* cheesy if you see it from
 *   up close, but from across the room, it's a nice touch of detail.
 *   I should probably add some bump mapping or other variation, but
 *   I'm lazy, okay?
 * 
 * PARAMETERS:
 *   Ka, Kd 	   	work just like the matte shader
 *   screwKs            Ks parameter for the screw
 *
 *
 * AUTHOR: written by Larry Gritz

 * HISTORY:
 *      June 1992 -- first written by lg for the Kitchen image
 *      17 Jan 1994 -- recoded by lg in correct shading language.
