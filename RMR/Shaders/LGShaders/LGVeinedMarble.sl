/*
 * veinedmarble.sl -- surface shader for a nice veined marble.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Makes solid marble texture with strong veins.  The "veincolor" parameter
 *   controls the color of the veins.  The background color is given by the
 *   surface color (Cs).
 * 
 * PARAMETERS:
 *   Ka, Kd, Ks, roughness, specularcolor - same as plastic
 *   veinfreq - controls fhe lowest frequency of the color veins
 *   veinlevels - how many "levels" of vein tendrills it has
 *   warpfreq - lowest frequency of the turbulent warping in the marble
 *   warping - controls how much turbulent warping there will be
 *   veincolor - the color of the veins
 *   sharpness - controls how sharp or fuzzy the veins are (higher = sharper)
