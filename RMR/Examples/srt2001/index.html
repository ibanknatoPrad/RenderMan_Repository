<a name="intro"></a>
Mach has been the first one to submit materials to the RMR.  I will add more materials as the presenters sent them to me.
<p>
Oct 12, 2001 --It seems that some people have had trouble reading the PowerPoint slides via StarOfice.  So I have uploaded a gzip'd StarOffice version of them:<p>
<a href="ConstantTiles.ssd.gz">ConstantTiles.ssd.gz</a> <br>
<a href="DeepShadows.sdd.gz">DeepShadows.ssd.gz</a>
<p>
July 31, 2002 -- Dan Goldman has HTML version of his presentation on his web site.  I added a link to it in his section.

<H2>Constant Tiled Textures</H2>
Mach Tony Kobayashi of Square USA presented a method of tiling on a scaling surface.
<P>
Here are his PowerPoint slides: <a href="ConstantTiles.ppt">ConstantTiles.ppt</a> (Remember Unix users you can use StarOffice to read these)<p>
<a href="MTK_tile.sl">MTK_tile.sl</a> is Mach's example shader.  NOTE: That his is just an example shader and one would want to do some optimizations for a "real" one.

<a name="deep"></a>
<H2>Deep Shadows</H2>
Mach Tony Kobayashi of Square USA presented how he implemented "Deep Shadows".
<p>
Here are his PowerPoint slides: <a href="DeepShadows.ppt">DeepShadows.ppt</a>. (Remember Unix users you can use StarOffice to read these)

<a name="bounce"></a>
<H2>Local Bounce Lighting in Surface Shaders</H2>
Christophe Hery, of ILM, presented a technique for faking self re-emission of light on a surface, useful for filling in "local" shadowed areas.<p>
<img src="../../pics/new.jpg">Here are Christophe's PowerPoint slides: <a href="local.bounce.ppt">local.bounce.ppt</a>.

<a name="oven"></a>
<H2>The RenderMan EZ-Bake Oven</H2>
Jonathan Litt and Dan Goldman, of ILM, showed a technique for "shader baking" - caching the output of shaders into a texture map. Great for computationally expensive or hard to alias shaders.<p>
This technique basically uses Pref to shade from the original 3d model onto a flat plan to capture the lighting to make into texture maps.
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/dgoldman/ezbake/">HTML</a> version of their presentation. (There are also little animations on some of these pages)
<p>

<a name="alfred"></a>
<H2>Using Alfred Effectively on Large Renderfarms</H2>
Wayne Wooten, of Pixar, presented tips and tricks for using Alfred on very large renderfarm installations.<p>
At the end he showed a really cool 3D gui for visualizing the traffic on Pixar's renderfarm!<p>
