Q: What is the charter for comp.graphics.rendering.renderman?
-------------------------------------------------------------

   comp.graphics.rendering.renderman is an unmoderated newsgroup
intended for the discussion of the RenderMan standard (e.g.
definition, semantics, usage, tips), the RenderMan shading language
(e.g. posted shaders, questions, tips), particular RenderMan
implementations, software that uses the RenderMan interface (e.g.
RIB-producing modelers, third party shaders), and comparisons,
comments and questions about RenderMan in general.

   This group is NOT intended for the distribution of images or RIB
files.  Large data or binary files should be uploaded to appropriate
FTP sites and announced on the newsgroup, but not posted directly.

Q: What is "RenderMan"?
-----------------------

Here's the most brief explanation I could come up with:

    According to RI (p. 3): "The RenderMan Interface is a standard
interface between modeling programs and rendering programs capable of
producing photorealistic quality images."

    RenderMan is in many respects similar to PostScript, but for 3D
primitives.  The goal is to provide a standard mechanism for modeling
and animation software to send data to rendering systems in a device-
independent way, and with minimal regard to the actual rendering
algorithms being used.  A particular RenderMan implementation may use
scanline methods (z-buffer, REYES), ray tracing, radiosity, or other
methods.

    An important aspect of the RenderMan Interface is the Shading
Language (SL).  SL breaks the restrictive paradigm of surfaces being
described by a small number of parameters (Ka, Kd, Ks, etc.).  SL
allows the user to write her own arbitrarily complex descriptions of
how lighting and shading should be computed.



Q: Where can I find documentation on the RenderMan Interface?
-------------------------------------------------------------

    Hot off the presses: _Advanced RenderMan: Creating CGI for Motion
Pictures_ by Tony Apodaca and Larry Gritz (Morgan-Kaufmann, 1999).
You can order from http://www.mkp.com or also from
http://www.amazon.com.  This book is quite comprehensive and will be
*the* bible for RenderMan use for some years to come, if I do say so
myself.  There's also web materials available from
http://www.mkp.com/renderman

    The official RenderMan Interface 3.1 specification is surprisingly
readable for a standard document, but not in any way a tutorial.  A
must for any serious RenderMan user, it's available online at Pixar's
site!  See:
	http://www.pixar.com/products/renderman/toolkit/RISpec/

    _The RenderMan Companion: A Programmer's Guide to Realistic
Computer Graphics_, by Steve Upstill (Addison-Wesley, 1989, ISBN
0-201-50868-0) is an excellent introduction to the procedural API and
the Shading Language.  Unfortunately, it doesn't address RIB at all,
and the SL section is rather naive -- no antialiasing, relatively
simple shaders, etc.  The next step for the advanced user is 
the Siggraph '98 course notes, described below.

    If you're interested in SL, or procedural shading in general,
check out _Textures and Modeling: A Procedural Approach_, by Ebert,
Musgrave, Peachey, Perlin, and Worley (Academic Press, 1994, ISBN
0-12-228760-6).  The source code (including RM shaders) can be found
at URL ftp://archive.cs.umbc.edu/pub/texture.  The second edition
was released in 1998, and contains updates and new material.

    There are several good course notes from courses taught at
SIGGRAPH conferences:
  Siggraph '90 course 18 - The RenderMan Interface & Shading Language
  Siggraph '92 course 21 - Writing RenderMan Shaders
  Siggraph '95 course 4 - Using RenderMan for Animation Production
  Siggraph '98 Course #11 - Advanced RenderMan: Beyond the Companion
  Siggraph '99 Course #25 - (repeat with revisions of the '98 course)
The '92 and '98/'99 notes are must-haves.  Several of these are available
downloadable in PDF form at
	 http://www.renderman.org/RMR/Books/index.html#Sig

    Here are some other technical papers that discuss either the
RenderMan Interface or some of the technologies behind its
implementation(s):

	Computer Graphics 21(4):95-102, 1987.  (Describes the rendering
	method that prman uses.)

    Gritz, Larry, and J.K. Hahn.  "BMRT: A Global Illumination
	Implementation of the RenderMan Standard", _Journal of Graphics
	Tools_, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 29-47, 1996.

    Slusallek, Pflaum, and Seidel. "Implementing RenderMan--Practice,
	Problems and Enhancements."  Proceedings of Eurographics '94.
	(Describes their implementation.)





Q: What's the difference between the procedural interface and RIB?
------------------------------------------------------------------

   Two bindings exist for the RenderMan Interface.  The first is a 
procedural API, i.e. a collection of library routines callable from
a C program.  Those functions all start with Ri, for example RiBegin().
The procedural API is explained in great detail in _RC_ and in the RI
standard document.

   The second binding is called RenderMan Interface Bytestream (RIB).
RIB is an ASCII (or binary) metafile format.  In general, there is a
one-to-one correspondence between the API calls and their equivalent
RIB directives.  RIB is useful for archival and later rendering,
rendering over a network, and hacking scenes by hand.  RIB is
unfortunately not documented in _RC_, but is exhaustively detailed in
_RI_.

   The usual way that RenderMan is used is for a program (modeler) to
make the procedural API calls.  The program is linked to a library
which, for each API call, outputs the corresponding RIB to a file.
That archived RIB can later be sent to a standalone renderer which
inputs the RIB and outputs rendered images.




Q: What features are required by the RI?  What is optional?
-----------------------------------------------------------

    The full list of requirements for a RenderMan-compliant renderer
is given in RI on pp. 5-7.

    Basically, a RenderMan-compliant renderer should minimally provide
the following features:

	Complete hierarchical graphics state
	Orthographic and perspective viewing transformations
	Hidden surface removal
	Pixel filtering and antialiasing
	Gamma correction and dithering before quantization
	Produce images containing any combination of RGB, A, and Z at a user
	  specified resolution
	Support all of the geometric primitives of the standard (including
	   quadrics, polygons, bilinear and bicubic patches, and NURBS)
	Provide the 14 standard light source, surface, volume, and
	   displacement shaders

    This is actually quite a lot -- you'll find few rendering systems,
free or commercial, which provide as many features as even the minimal
RenderMan requirements.

    In addition, RenderMan-compliant renderers may support several
optional capabilities.  Many of these features are very advanced, and
some rendering algorithms simply cannot support certain features, so
the availability will tend to vary from implementation to
implementation.  The optional capabilities include:

	Solid Modeling (CSG)		Trim Curves for NURBS
	Multiple Levels of Detail	Motion Blur
	Depth of Field			Area Light Sources
	Deformations			Displacements
	Spectral Colors			Texture Mapping
	Environment Mapping		Bump Mapping
	Shadow Depth Mapping		Volume Shading
	Ray Tracing			Radiosity
	Programmable Shading (in Shading Language)
	Special Camera Projections

    However, even though the RI 3.1 spec said that they were optional,
we've long come to realize that Shading Language, Texture Mapping,
Shadow Depth Mapping, and Environment Mapping are absolutely
essential.  If a new spec were issued, they would surely be mandatory
(except for realtime "preview" renderers that were not attempting to
achieve high quality).



Q: What do I have to do in order to call my software "RenderMan
---------------------------------------------------------------
compliant"?
-----------

    You must support all of the required features, including all of
the geometric primitive types.  You must implement all of the API
calls or RIB requests, even for features you don't support (i.e. at
least have function stubs so your library accepts the calls).  You
must not allow information to be sent through any alternative calls
not defined by the interface, and you may not use any alternate
language for programmable shading.

    If you write a RenderMan compliant renderer, you must obtain a
no-charge license from Pixar (in writing).  You basically attest that
your software is compliant with the standard and that you won't abuse
Pixar's trademark and copyrights.

    Modeling programs which use the RI standard (i.e. output RIB or
make the API calls) may do so without a license, but must display
Pixar's copyrights as follows:

	The RenderMan (R) Interface Procedures and Protocol are:
		Copyright 1988, 1989, Pixar
		  All Rights Reserved




Q: What implementations of the RenderMan standard are available?
----------------------------------------------------------------

   There are currently three widely used RenderMan-compliant renderers:
PRMan, BMRT, and RDC.  All are fully compliant with the RenderMan
spec, and have been used in various productions.  A couple less-used
ones have recently popped up, also.  Several other proprietary
implementations no doubt exist, but to the best of my knowledge they
are not available commercially or otherwise.

   Pixar's PhotoRealistic RenderMan ("PRMan", for short) is the most
widely used implementation.  These guys are, after all, the
originators of the standard, so their implementation is of very high
quality.  PRMan is used by many production houses, including ILM,
Digital Domain, Disney, and others.  It was used to render effects for
The Abyss, Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, Casper, Apollo 13, Contact,
Starship Troopers, Toy Story (Classic and II), A Bug's Life, Star Wars
I, and many other films.  PRMan is available on several UNIX platforms
and on Windows NT as the RenderMan Toolkit (retails for $5000 per
processor).  Call Pixar for product information (800-888-9856).

   Larry Gritz has a shareware implementation, called the Blue Moon
Rendering Tools (BMRT).  It supports ray tracing and radiosity, area
lights, full implementation of Shading Language, volume and imager
shaders, displacements, and other advanced features.  It also comes
with a real-time RIB previewer (using OpenGL).  BMRT runs on SGI,
Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, Windows 95/98/NT, DEC (both OSF and Alpha
Linux).  There are no Mac, Be, or DOS versions.  Information about
BMRT is available from http://www.bmrt.org

    RenderDotC (RDC), written by Rick Lamont of Dot C Software, is a
RenderMan-compliant REYES renderer for Windows 95/NT, SGI, and Linux.
More information from http://www.dotcsw.com/

   The University of Erlangen's Vision project is an object-oriented
RenderMan-compliant renderer.  Information may be found at:
http://www9.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/eng/research/rendering/vision
Also check out Philipp Slusallek's PhD about the Vision system,
available on the same site.  They're not terribly specific about
the distribution policy -- they seem able to distribute to "selected
institutions", but I don't believe they are widely distributing their
package.

    Advanced Rendering Technology (ART) promises a "raytracer
on a chip" which is supposed to be compliant with the RenderMan
Interface.  Info is at: http://www.art-render.com

    Just in alpha-test is AQSIS (pronounced "axis"), a new
RenderMan-compliant renderer.  Details from: http://www.maxdepth.demon.co.uk



Q: Is PRMan a ray tracer?  How can PRMan do reflections if it's not a
   ray tracer?  Was a ray tracer used for reflections in Toy Story?
   How about for A Bug's Life?  Toy Story 2?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   PRMan IS NOT A RAYTRACER.  It uses the Reyes algorithm (much as
described in the 1987 SIGGRAPH paper, though with many enhancements
and improvements).  Environment and reflection mapping do quite
reasonable approximations to reflection and refraction, in a fraction
of the time it usually takes a ray tracer.  Sometimes the reflections
don't look quite correct compared to a ray tracer, but this is almost
never a problem and almost always worth the time savings.

   Pixar used the very same version of PRMan for Toy Story (and all
their other work) as they sell to the public.  You can see examples of
how well PRMan does reflections and refractions, not only in Toy
Story, but also in The Abyss and Terminator 2.

   However, ray tracing *was* used for 15 shots of "A Bug's Life."
(Look for the glass bottles!)  For these shots, BMRT and PRMan were
used together (with BMRT doing the ray tracing, PRMan doing everything
else).  The same technique of combining BMRT and PRMan was also used
for "Stuart Little."  The method used to combine the renderers is
described in the _Advanced RenderMan_ book, as well as in the BMRT
documentation (release 2.4 and later).

   This technique was not used in Toy Story 2.  All the reflections
in TS2 were good old PRMan environment maps.





Q: Is there a Macintosh/OS X/Be/Other port of BMRT?  In the works?
   Will the author of BMRT let me do the port to Mac/OS X/Be/Other ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

   The short answer is: No.  It is unlikely that the list of supported
platforms will grow in the near future. 

   BMRT is currently supported on SGI, Linux (on Intel and DECAlpha),
Solaris (on SPARCs), DEC Alpha (both OSF and Linux) and Windows.  If
you have a PC, I strongly recommend looking into Linux, a free (!)
UNIX implementation that runs on Intel 486/Pentium systems.

   BMRT's author doesn't wish to release source code, nor does he
currently want to port to non-UNIX OS's (on which he has neither the
access nor expertise, nor the desire to acquire either).  He's turned
down offers to port to Cray (among others), so it's not likely you'll
convince him to port to the Mac.  This is not a snub at users of the
Mac or any other platform, just a reality of the life of the author
and his finite time and resources.

   No, BMRT's author is not willing/able to distribute BMRT source
for ports, even under nondisclosure.




Q: How can I make objects cast semi-transparent shadows in BMRT?
   When I try, the shadows look fully opaque.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If your object is semi-transparent and the shader sets Oi to something
less than 1 (i.e. it uses "compositing transparency"), then you just
need to add this to your RIB file (in the attribute scope of the
object in question):

	Attribute "render" "casts_shadows" ["shade"]

(See the BMRT documentation for other options for this command.)

BUT... if you have something computing true refraction (like the
glass.sl shader that comes with BMRT), then your shader looks 
something like:

	...
        color cr = Krefr * trace (P, refract (I, N, eta));
	Oi = 1;
        Ci = Cs * (Ka*ambient() + Kd*diffuse(Nf)) +
	     specularcolor * Ks*specular(P,Nf,V,roughness) +
	     transmitcolor * cr ;

So that will still cast an opaque shadow because you are explicitly
setting Oi=1!  (Get it?)

The most straightforward way to deal with this (if you have BMRT 2.4
or later) is to use the new built-in isshadowray() function to make
your shader set Oi differently for shadow checks:

	if (isshadowray() == 1) {
	    /* shadow -- fake Oi to be <1 */
	    Oi = color(1,1,1) - (Kr * transmitcolor);
	} else {
	    /* viewing ray */
            color cr = Krefr * trace (P, refract (I, N, eta));
   	    Oi = 1;
            Ci = Cs * (Ka*ambient() + Kd*diffuse(Nf)) +
	         specularcolor * Ks*specular(P,Nf,V,roughness) +
	         transmitcolor * cr ;
	}

In combination with the "casts_shadows" ["shade"] attribute, this
should do the trick.




Q: What front ends (modelers, etc) support the RenderMan Interface?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This information was supplied by many people, so it's hard to verify
its accuracy, and it certainly contains individuals' opinions.  Often,
this info comes from the companies supplying the products.  I do not
necessarily endorse any of the products listed, though if I find out
that any are particularly good or bad, I will note it.  The products
are listed in no particular order, though I've broken it into the
categories of: modelers, plugins or converters, and "other".  If you
know of other front ends or products which use RenderMan, please send
me a short paragraph and I will include it here.

Modelers & Animation Systems which can output RIB natively
----------------------------------------------------------

   Side Effects' Houdini system (modeling & animation) has very
good RenderMan support (both PRMan and BMRT).  It also includes the
ability to create shaders *within* the program by a visual means and
export out the shader source for tweaking and compiling.  [ed. note -
I have heard great things about this package.]  Details at:
www.sidefx.com

   Rhino is a Windows (NT or 95) based NURBS modeler which recently
added RIB support.  Their site has a free beta available for download:
http://www.rhino3d.com/
Related tools that suppliment Rhino's RIB export (e.g., by making
shader assignments easier) include RhinoRIB 
(http://www.geocities.com/nopeppers/) and Gorilla 
(http://home.flash.net/~bp4019).  Also check out J. Aberg's page 
with tips on using BMRT with Rhino (http://home5.swipnet.se/~w-52046/).

   Steve May at the Ohio State University has written an animation
language ("AL"), inspired by the Menv system that's used at Pixar.  It
has great RIB support and is programmable in some very interesting
ways.  It runs on Linux and UNIX platforms and provides a complete,
procedurally-oriented interface to PRMan and BMRT.  More info is
available from:  http://www.cgrg.ohio-state.edu/~smay/AL

   AC3D is a 3D modeler by Andy Colebourne.  It's polygon based, but
does extrusions, revolutions, etc.  It's quite nice, runs on Linux,
SGI, Sun, and now Windows, and demo versions are available as
shareware.  And it outputs RIB, among other formats.  More info, and
downloading the software, available at:
http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/users/andy/ac3dlinux.html

    Vertigo's Animation Machine software (modeler & animation system)
has very nice support for RenderMan output, but it's only a polygon
based modeler.  You can generate RIB files or render directly.
Vertigo comes with the prman runtime library linked in for integrated
rendering, or you can buy Vertigo bundled with prman.  Their phone
number is 604-684-2113.

    Macromedia's MacroModel's was a spline-based modeler for Mac and
Win, with pretty good RIB export.  But it's now defunct.  So it goes.

    MicroStation is a general purpose CAD program which can be used as
a modeler.  It supports NURBS, CSG, fillets, and blends, and can
output RIB.  It's available for UNIX, DOS, and Windows.  I believe it
is actually written by Bentley Systems, but is marketed by Intergraph.
Cheap academic versions are available ($150?).  Bentley Systems can be
reached at: (610)458-5000 or academic AT bentley DOT com  (regarding the
academic package.)

    3DReality from Stone Design Corp. (505) 345-4800 info AT stone DOT com 
Runs on NEXTSTEP.  A little long in the tooth and has some quirks, but
it's built of dynamically loadable bundles and offers a very accesible
API for adding your own shapes, tools, etc. Reads and writes RIBS just
fine. Really, really good academic discounts and very friendly tech
support.

   Hash Inc. sells a spline based animation package that is excellent
for character animation.  The .ribs are exported frame by frame.  It
is available for PC, PowerPC, and WinNT on SGI, MIPS and a few others.
It has particle effects, skinning, channels, spline deformation and
more.  http://www.hash.com/~hashinc/  [ed. note: I've been told that
this package produces very bad RIB]

   ...However, Mike Hough has written a RIB export plugin for
Hash Animation Master '99, available from:
http://free.prohosting.com/~olana/plugins/am2rib/

   Amapi 2.05 is mainly a modeller that is fairly good for creating
characters.  It uses NURBS, Splines and Polys.  Intuitive interface
unlike any. http://www.yonowat.com

   Alias PowerAnimator (also for SGI), versions 5 & 6, output rib,
NURBS including trim curves.  [ed. note: Alias's RIB output is
notoriously mediocre.]

   Intuitiv'3d from Intuitive Systems, Inc. tel: 415-852-0245
fax:415-852-1271, info AT intuisys DOT com DOT    Runs on NEXTSTEP.  Sports a
terrific interface but is rather slow.  Great realtime previews of
lighting and shape, so-so modeling tools, great shader manipulation,
including "MetaShaders" which store surface, color, displacement and
lighting shader info in a single entity.  Reads RIBS but saves to its
own proprietary format (.i3dw)

Email: info AT solid DOT gestel DOT it , WWW: http://www.gestel.it
   For Windows 95/NT, this industrial-strength modeler from Italy
approaches Alias in its power and refinement. Great modeling tools
including NURBS, control of every RenderMan parameter, fast and smooth
manipulation of objects and lights. Reads and writes RIBS, support for
both PRMan and BMRT, reads Wavefront, TDDD and DXF files too.

   Breeze Designer is a 32-bit 3D modelling and design tool for
Windows NT, Windows 95 and Win32s with exports for the Persistance of

Other Tools
-----------

   RenderWrapper (RW) is a simple Tcl/Tk script for conveniently
setting the parameters for the rendrib, rgl, and rendribv renderers
from BMRT.  It provides a GUI for rendering single or multiple frames

utilities, utilities to parameterize NURBS in RIB files by arc length,
polish up RIB files generated by Alias, etc.  More info and download
at: http://www.affine.com/

   The "Rib Tickler" is a freeware IDE; its main purpose is the
editing of ASCII RIB - like it or not, the current crop of Windows'
based RIB exporters still require a lot of tweaking of the ASCII RIB
output, especially where materials are concerned.  And speaking of
materials, rib tickler allows you to code, compile, and preview
shaders, right from the IDE.  Details and download from:
 http://www.wfmm.com/ribtickler/

Q: Where can I get the Pixar videos?
------------------------------------

Pixar's animation video (which contains Luxo Jr, Reds Dream, Tin Toy
and Knickknack) is available directly from Pixar.  The cost is $25.00.
Just call 1 800-888-9856 or 510-236-4000.  The tape is available in
both VHS NTSC and PAL formats.

Recently, the Pixar shorts were released by Disney Home Video as
"Tiny Toy Stories".  You should be able to find them at your local
video store for around $10.




Q: What is the correct capitalization of "Pixar"?
-------------------------------------------------

   It's written "Pixar", just as it is throughout this FAQ.  I don't
know why people keep capitalizing it, perhaps they are trying to
duplicate the logo, which is in a particular typeface and happens to
be all caps.  In any case, it's not an acronym like IBM.  It's a
regular company name like Disney.
