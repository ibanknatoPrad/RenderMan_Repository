Moved DP stuff out of TMShaders to DPShaders.
Really should change the hdocs to : instead of tabs.  
Change  data to to assoitive array so don't need lots of different for loops to find info.  Make procedures to access and return this info.

Renamed KMStarfield to LGStarfield.

Found missing text and pictures for the nebula animation and put them back on the rmShowAndTell page.  Touched up the rmShowandTell page (consistent name sections and a "WHAT's on this page" section.  mv rmLightBlockers.htmld to just rmBlockers, cleaned up that one, too.

The rmHoudini page has a broken link to LC starfield shader.

saturn animation -- the RIB is really messed up, fix it to use the right shaders and to use LC's starfield.  It will need frequency 40 and useYZplane 1

Remeber to remove gifs from mike's site.

In RIBS it seems as though the animation is missing for mech toy.
updated mechtoy.rib, have pic and animation.

Updated Uberlight (rmBlockers/uber/)

DSOs need to create a shader function  (done)

Really should write a program that will find modified files.  List them and maybe tar them up. (done dateTar.pl)

Need to fix buildShaders.html to use new nav tools. (DONE 10/16/99)

IDShaders -- need to be careful when rebuilding -- buidShaders is expecting tiff files for TOC and am using jpg.

groupShaders isn't always getting the pictures, why?

updated buildShaderHTML.pl to emit nav_table.

Started to set up Wave to have his own page.  His shaders are missing.

Should also do create a new site index; shader group.
Find out why shader group is messing up images.

Need to update Mike King's shader from mail

Hello,

I found a site  with some interesting programs that can output rib files:

    - a 3D modeller with a built-in math parser for creating
      parametric surfaces and implicit functions (free dimensions)

    - a set of programs for processing meshes  (smesh)


The address is:

create make files for RMR shaders
   then run group shaders once have html pages for shaders created
   with makefiles.
set up include / tar file for includes
ask LG about arman online at RMR
think about include standards for Rudy to make use of.

Actually going to make those actual copies so edit can be done and not affect the others.

Rudy's arman code seemse to be newer than my by a couple of months.
