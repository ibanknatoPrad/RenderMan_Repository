Amoung other things, with rsl2gsl, one can parse the RenderMan shading language (RSL) and either write out RenderMan or Gelato shaders.

To get a copy go to the <a href="download/">download directory</a>. Note for those not familar with the syntax.  The packages, <i>.tgz</i></a> are in a gzip'ed tar file.  (For Windows users, if you get <a href="www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> as I recommend, it has the needed executable to extract the files: tar.)

Version 1.0.0 is now released.  Here are excerpts from the ChangeLog:
<pre>
1.0.0 July 27, 2005
	[[ ]] can now be interpreted as rawblocks (RB).
	Fixed bug where only one RB could occur in the same statement block area.
	Fixed bug where dangling ';' in parameter list would cause a parsing error.
	Fixed bug where two empty statements would cause a parsing error.
	
	Handles break and continue keywords.

	Added gtrace() for Gelato's trace() as opposed to RMan's trace call.
		This saves the code duplication that would have occured by 
		using a RB.

	Support for RMan illuminance send/recieve message passing.

0.9.1 February 17, 2005
	Handles array initializers that are negative numbers:

	float a[2] = {-1, -2}
	

0.9.0 January 01, 2005
	Tries to handle cases like:
		vector v = (0, 0, 0);

		to
		
		vector v = vector (0, 0, 0);

		Gelato needs implicit cast.
	
	Closer to releasing source code.
	
0.8.3 November 29, 2004
	Handles internal void functions

	Another "current" -> "common" case handled.
	
0.8.2 November 18, 2004
	Fixed another case dealing with "current"->"common" space translation
		vtransform ( "shader", "current", vhsl );

	Before only the first paramter was being considered.

0.8.1 October 05, 2004
	"current"->"commom" space translation missed case:
		origin = point "current" (0, 0, 0);

0.8 September 23, 2004
	Several minor fixes/changes
		Will change "current" to "common" for transformation space changes.
	
		illuminance(), illuminate() blocks will not longer cause a ';' to be emited if the argument list is empty.
		The ?: triop has been changed.  Even less cases, than what were allowed in 0.7, will be accepted by the parser.  Consult the ReadMe.html for more details.

		translator will allow for (int i = 0;...).  You will need Gelato 1.1 or greater for the shader compiler to accept this.
		
		Removed limitation of "yiq" as a color space.  You will need Gelato 1.1 or greater for the shader compiler to accept this.
	
	ReadMe.html has been updated.  New sections include:
		Caution with the ?: operator
		Manual intervention with translating light shaders may be needed.
