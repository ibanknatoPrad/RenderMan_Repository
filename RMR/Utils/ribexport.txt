Hi,

I've been tinkering more or less with Maya ribexport so that it can
export poly UVs.

What I got is somehow working, I'm not familiar with C++ (just know a
little C), so that my
coding is certainly quite messy.
However, I'll post the source in case it might be of use for you.

Until now limitations are :

It's not optimised ! like the original RIBexport it will create a lot of
vertex (one vertex per polygon

using it, no shared vertices).

The model has to be clean (no non-winged vertices and it has better be
triangulated, but it already

gave better results with the original version)

The model has to be fully UVmapped, unmapped faces will likely crash it
(but it handles errors, it
should not crash Maya don't worry).

For those of you using Renderman, don't bother with it, MTOR is doing a
far better job.

You'll need BMRT libriboutMTDLL library as well as OpenMaya, OpenMayaUI,

OpenMayaAnim and Foundation libs

My modifs all reside in the RibMeshData::RibMeshData( MObject mesh )
declaration.

Thanks to Larry Gritz for explaining to me what's in the BMRT libs and
what is not.

Thanks to Alias support for teaching me not to forget libs in my build
projects (hum, sorry for
asking silly questions guys)

Your comments and suggestions/error reports are welcomed !

Regards,
