The License file invokes the original RMR copyright for the content in the repository.

However, note there are a number of copyrighted materials sitting in the repository
where the copyright supersedes the RMR license associated with this git repo.  At
the time, I was given permission for those copyrighted materials found on the site

Why is the RMR copyrighted and how does it affect me?

This site is copyrighted to help protect the contents of the site and everybody who
has contributed to it.   Part of the reason for this site is to help people learn
RenderMan better.  You are free to download the contents and make use of the
materials for your own personal (or even your companies local use).  But if you
have the urge to start distributing the contents (including the pictures derived
from the shaders and RIBs) in any form please observe the following:

1) Give the originators the credit they deserve.
2) Let me know that you are doing so.
3) (Optional but it would make me happy) Let them know where you got them from ie.
The RenderMan Repository

What if I contributed something how does it affect me?

Not very much.  Your stuff is still your stuff.  I just want to make sure you are
given credit when it is being used by others.
